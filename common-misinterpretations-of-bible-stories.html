Jesus drank from the Holy Grail during the Last Supper</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-b829899f-5e7f-48fe-9bbb-ba4879e0f01b data-caption="The Holy Grail has become a popular motif in medieval Arthurian legends [Shutterstock]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/IAQktkpTURBXy8zMjk5OTI2OWFmOTFjZGEzZDc3N2RkNGRlM2NjNTdmMC5qcGeSlQMAAM0DFM0CDZUCzQMUzQINwsM></span><p>The Scriptures do mention that Jesus drank from the chalice at the Last Supper, but there is no indication that the vessel was in any way sacred or intended to remain in the hands of any of the Apostles.</p><p>The general knowledge we have about the Holy Grail was invented for the plot of the legends of King Arthur. The greatest influence on the subsequent development of the Grail legends was <strong>Robert de Boron</strong>, writing about 10 to 20 years after <strong>Chreten de Troyes</strong>. He was the first to use the adjective "holy" and link the Grail with the life of Jesus.</p><p>According to Boron, the Holy Grail is the chalice used by Jesus at the Last Supper, which then fell into the hands of <strong>Joseph of Arimathea</strong>, who in turn used it to collect Christ's blood after he was taken down from the cross.</p><p>Since then, the Holy Grail has become a popular motif in medieval Arthurian legends, in which knights set off on adventurous journeys to find the mythical cup.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>2.

As it turns out, however, the Bible does not precisely state that the fruit was actually an apple.</p><p>"Let the earth bring forth green plants: grasses yielding seed, and fruit trees yielding fruit upon the earth according to their kind, with seeds in them."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>3. Jesus wasn't born on December 25</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-d9483ede-7e58-4dce-89c9-928ff3c647aa data-caption="The birth of Jesus Christ is one of the most popular stories in history [Shutterstock]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/ALaktkpTURBXy8wNTI5OWJiMjQ1Yzc0NWZiYTg1N2NkZDgzNDI3YTQ3NS5qcGeSlQMAAM0DFM0BsZUCzQMUzQGxwsM></span><p>There is no information in the Holy Scriptures about the date of Jesus' birth. There is no question of December 25 or the time of year.</p><p>What is known is that Christ was born in Bethlehem, that shepherds lived or camped in the fields with their sheep, and that a national census was taking place - making it much more likely that he was born in summer or autumn.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-19>4. Mary Magdalene was not a prostitute</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>There is no evidence in the Bible that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute or even an adulteress. The Holy Scripture only mentions it just before the crucifixion of Christ in the Gospel of St. Luke when she is freed from the power of seven demons.</p><p>"And there were with Him the Twelve and several women whom He delivered from evil spirits and from infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, whom seven evil spirits had left," we read.</p><p>It was only in later years that she began to be identified as a "sinful woman," but she still did not have to be a prostitute. Mary Magdalene was often confused with a woman caught in adultery, but biblical scholars point out that this is not supported by the Holy Scriptures.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-23>5. The Holy Trinity does not appear in the Holy Scriptures</h3></p><p>The Bible clearly says that God appears in three forms: Father, Son and Holy Spirit, but the concept of the "Trinity" itself does not appear in any of the texts. So, by enumerating the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, does Christ the Lord teach us about the existence of three gods? Absolutely not.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>For many centuries, the chosen people have been led to reject polytheism and brought up to understand that God is one, and there can only be One. The word "Trinity" was introduced by Tertullian (2nd/3rd century), one of the fathers of the early Church, to define the doctrine of divinity. It means: "triple" or "three in one."</p><p>The word "trinity" is not used in the Bible, but the words "three" and "one" appear, and their combination shows that <a href=# id=64e4c5a4-2fcb-4d61-bd18-7ff4168a8c40 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>the biblical God is Triune</a> in his nature and essence.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-27>6.

Two of every kind of bird, beast, and creeping thing of the earth; let them come into you, lest they perish."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Of all clean animals, take with you seven males and seven females, and from the unclean animals one pair, a male and a female; and from the birds, seven males and seven females, so that you may preserve their descendants for all the earth," we read in the Bible.</p><p>Therefore, although many stories say that Noah took a pair of all kinds of animals on the Ark, the Scriptures show that the situation was somewhat different. So what was a clean animal? According to Deuteronomy, it was any animal with a cloven hoof that chews the cud, such as cattle, sheep, goats and deer.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-32>7. Jesus was not visited by the Three Kings</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-be5398a3-aef0-4d57-86bf-ebab33c6133f data-caption="The story of The Three Kings visiting Jesus at birth has some important context [Shutterstock]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/VXRktkpTURBXy82MDk0MTI4NDE0YmFkN2NmN2JmNmE2MDMyNGIxYWUyMC5qcGeSlQMAAM0DFM0BVpUCzQMUzQFWwsM></span><p>It is extremely difficult to determine who the Three Kings were. The only mention of their origin limits the reader's search to the unspecified East.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>However, if we look at the Bible, and more specifically the Gospel of St. Matthew, we will learn that Baby Jesus was not visited by the Three Kings or even the Three Wise Men, but in fact by the "Magi from the East." However, the Holy Bible clearly condemns all magic and anthology.</p><p>Therefore, when translating the Scriptures, it was assumed that the Magi who worshiped Jesus should not be enumerated - so they quickly began to be called Magi, and later their rank was raised and they were called Kings.</p><p>This article was originally published on <a href=# id=ce445815-2dd8-44a6-92bc-4f9458d1684c data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Onet Woman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLCwucyopWalmai2r8DEq6ernaSWwaq7zaxkqJ5dl7ajuMRmqq2nop6ytHvToW%2BqbqSr</p></div><div id=links><a href=./cybersecurity-concerns-net-neutrality-repeal-led-2017-tech-policy-with-2018-legislative-and-legal-fights-looming.html>&#171;&nbsp;Cybersecurity Concerns, Net Neutrality Repeal Led 2017 Tech Policy, With 2018 Legislative and Legal</a>
