We breakdown the debate that took place here in PoliticsLab…</b></h3><p>Currently the law in England, Wales and Scotland states that – emergencies aside –two doctors must approve a woman's request for an abortion before it is allowed to proceed. Under this system, a woman seeking an abortion must have two doctors who agree that her physical or mental health and wellbeing are at risk if she carries on with the pregnancy.</p><p>Controversy was sparked recently when <a href=#>surprise inspections</a> on more than 250 abortion clinics found evidence of blank forms being pre-signed in anticipation of patients seeking a termination.</p><p>This discovery called into question the ‘two doctors’ process, where critics felt the incidence of pre-signed forms effectively bypassed a second medical examination, and implied that some healthcare professionals believe this process to be redundant.</p><h2><b>When we invited you to discuss the necessity of having two doctors sign off an abortion in Labs, we could have expected the debate over this emotive issue to be polarised.</b></h2><h3><b>Labs participants were split</b><b> on this topic for varying reasons, from whether this process is beneficial to women and healthcare in general, to whether it is an outdated and onerous method that should be abolished.</b></h3><p>Those who said they were <b>against</b> the law tended to believe that <b>obtaining two doctors' signatures is condescending to the woman and anachronistic</b>, as there are no other situations where a patient requires permission from two third parties to make a personal healthcare decision.</p><p>Many of those who were opposed to the process said that procuring two signatures <b>causes an unnecessary hindrance to abortion services</b>, with delays experienced by some women during GP referrals (<b>and the refusal by some GPs to forward these requests directly on grounds of conscience</b>).</p><p>However, participants <b>in favour</b> of the law said they saw the need for two doctors as <b>a safeguard to protect the interests of both the patient and the doctor</b>.</p><p>They added that in the event of<b> a woman being coerced</b> into an abortion, seeking a second opinion will allow the patient <b>more time to consider her options</b>, with the <b>additional support of two healthcare professionals</b> for guidance.</p><p>Others taking a pro-life stance, felt that a second doctor will help prevent bias and ensure terminations are carried out for reasons other than contraceptive or illegal purposes.</p><p>Here's what our PoliticsLabs participants had to say...</p><h2>1.
