Mills recommends the Nuna PIPA RX, saying that, “Weighing only 7.6 lbs, the PIPA RX is great for parents always on the go.” He especially notes the fact it uses chemical free fabrics, its four recline positions, and the optional RELX base, which makes installing the seat in most vehicles a straightforward process.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Passenger Weight: 4 - 32 pounds</li><li>Carrier Weight: 7.6 pounds</li><li>Dimensions: 25.2 inches long x 17.5 inches wide x 23 inches high</li><li>Height limit: 32 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $400</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Lightweight</li><li>10 color options</li><li>Stability legs with crumple zone</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some reviews say the carrying handle is a little uncomfortable</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A lightweight, easy to use and, above all, super safe car seat.</p><h3>Best infant car seat and stroller combo: <a rel=nofollow href=#>UPPAbaby Vista V2 and Mesa Max Travel System</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best infant car seat and stroller combo</span></p><p><h3 class=title>UPPAbaby Vista V2 and Mesa Max Travel System</h3></p><p>Combine a universally-loved stroller with a matching car seat for the best car-to-sidewalk transition. Mills praises the fact that you can attach this car seat without the use of car seat adaptors, as well as the one-handed release button on the carry handle. And if you like the look of the car seat, but already have a different UPPAbaby stroller, don’t worry–it fits with other models, too, like the Cruz.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Passenger Weight: 4 - 35 pounds</li><li>Carrier Weight: 9.9 pounds</li><li>Dimensions: 25.8 inches long x 17 inches wide x 23 inches high</li><li>Height limit: 32 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $1,329.98</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Five car seat colors, nine stroller colors</li><li>Steel-reinforced legs</li><li>Greenguard Gold certified</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Nothing–reviews are unanimously good for this pairing</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A super convenient and reliable pairing, with a stroller that’ll keep growing with your little one.</p><h3>Best affordable infant car seat: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Baby Trend Lightweight EZ Lift 35 Plus</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best affordable infant car seat</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Baby Trend EZ-Lift 35 PLUS Infant Car Seat, Ultra Grey</h3></p><p>Nothing makes you feel like you’re hemorrhaging money quite like having a new baby.

This seat, though, can make things a little easier. “This is a great travel solution,” says Mills. “Not only is it FAA approved, but with a push of a button the Doona car seat converts into a stroller, meaning you don’t have to bring a separate stroller with you on your vacation.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Passenger Weight: 4 - 35 pounds</li><li>Carrier Weight: 17 pounds</li><li>Dimensions: 26 inches long x 17.4 inches wide x 22.4 inches high</li><li>Height limit: 32 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $550</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Extremely convenient</li><li>FAA approved</li><li>Comes fully assembled</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Much heavier than a regular infant car seat, due to it also being a stroller</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An incredibly convenient, compact car seat/stroller twofer, ideal for long trips.</p><h3>Best crash test analysis infant car seat: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Clek Liing</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best crash test analysis infant car seat</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Clek Liing Infant Car Seat with Adjustable Load Leg, Compact, Lightweight Design, 7 Recline Positions, and Easy-to-Use Rigid LATCH (Pitch Black - Prior Year 2023 Model)</h3></p><p>“This is the second recommendation for this infant car seat, but its independent crash scores are so good that the Liing deserves to be recognised,” says Mills of this compact Canadian car seat. “The rigid LATCH system and load leg help ensure minimal movement during testing, and the installation is clear and simple, reducing chances of an incorrect fit.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Passenger Weight: 4 - 35 pounds</li><li>Carrier Weight: 9 pounds</li><li>Dimensions: 27.7 inches long x 16.9 inches wide x 26.8 inches high</li><li>Height limit: 32 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $499.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Extremely safe</li><li>Energy-absorbing metal load leg</li><li>Side impact protection</li><li>Suitable for preemies</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A little pricey</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>As well as being compact, this is an extremely safe model, making it a no-brainer for those worried that a smaller car might be less safe for their child.</p><h3>Best infant car seat for quality and comfort: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Cybex Cloud Q</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best infant car seat for quality and comfort</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Cybex Cloud Q SensorSafe Reclining Infant Car Seat - Spring Blossom Light</h3></p><p>Anyone seeking a truly high end option will find the Cloud Q worth their time. “The Cloud Q from Cybex, part of their Platinum collection, offers premium fabrics and materials in conjunction with class leading safety performance,” says Mills.

This additional testing incurs costs for car seat brands, and it’s undeniably reflected in the prices of the top-performing baby car seats.”</p><h3>Safety features</h3><p>Some car seats offer safety enhancements that can help improve their performance in a crash. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Joe Colella</a>, <a rel=nofollow href=#>JPMA</a> director of child passenger safety and 2020 child passenger safety Hall of Fame inductee, recommends looking for the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Load legs or stability legs</strong>, which have been shown to reduce the amount of crash energy transferred to the child.</li><li><strong>Enhanced side-impact protection features</strong> to improve child safety in crashes from more directions. “While all car seats made after June 30, 2025 will be required to meet side impact performance regulations, some models already have features built in that have been crash tested for improved outcomes,” says Colella.</li><li><strong>Alert systems</strong> designed to warn a driver if a child is inadvertently left in the car, to prevent hot car tragedies. “Some of these alert systems can also communicate with the driver if the child is not fully buckled in or if other issues are present,” Colella adds.</li></ul><h3>Size</h3><p>A car seat has to fit your child perfectly, but also your car. “The right car seat is one designed for your child’s height, weight, age, and developmental needs,” says Colella. The instructions included with the seat will tell you the height and weight ranges it’s appropriate for. In terms of how it fits in the car, Colella says that, “The car seat must be correctly attached to the vehicle to perform its functions. Following car seat installation instructions and vehicle owner’s manual guidance is crucial.”</p><h3>Ease of Installation</h3><p>This point isn’t just about making your life easier, it’s about ensuring anyone using your car seat (say, if you left the baby with Grandpa for the day) can easily figure out how it works. “Proper installation is paramount for safety–the safest car seat is one that is installed correctly,” says Cavasino. “Choose an infant car seat that is user-friendly and comes with clear installation instructions. Some models may include features like color-coded indicators or built-in leveling systems to assist with correct installation.”</p><h3>Adjustability</h3><p>“Consider car seats that offer adjustable features to ensure a secure and comfortable fit for your child,” advises Cavasino. “Adjustable harness heights, recline positions, and headrests contribute to the adaptability of the seat as your child grows.”</p><h3>Ease of cleaning</h3><p>From overflowing diapers to car sickness incidents to spilled snacks and drinks, every parent knows that car seats can very quickly become disgusting. It’s definitely worth considering a seat with machine-washable covers.</p><h3>Longevity</h3><p>“Consider the car seat's suitability for long-term use, and expiration date, especially if you plan to use it for the infant stage for multiple children,” says Cavasino. “One advantage of a convertible car seat is that accommodating different stages of growth might be a cost-effective and practical choice.”</p><p>While that might all seem like a lot, it’s well worth taking the time to absorb.

This weight limit aligns with the average age of an infant, typically reaching 12-15 months.”</p><p>If you’re unsure about whether it’s time to replace your seat, Cavasino advises considering the following:</p><p><strong>● Expiration date:</strong> Infant car seats have an expiration date, usually around six to ten years after the manufacturing date. It's crucial to replace the car seat before it expires to ensure continued safety.</p><p>● <strong>Technological advancements:</strong> Consider replacing the infant car seat if there have been significant technological advancements in car seat safety since your original purchase.</p><p><strong>● Wear and tear:</strong> Regularly inspect the car seat for any signs of wear and tear. If you notice any damage or if the seat has been involved in a moderate to severe crash, it's time to replace it.</p><h3>What’s the difference between an infant car seat and a convertible car seat?</h3><p>“Infant car seats are typically designed for our youngest and smallest children, with minimum weights of three or four pounds and upper limits ranging from 20 to 35 pounds, and may only be installed and used facing the rear of the vehicle,” says Colella. “Convertible models can be used facing the rear of the vehicle for specified child height and weight ranges, and then can be converted for forward-facing use with separate height and weight ranges.”</p><h3>How long do babies stay in infant car seats?</h3><p>Babies should remain in rear-facing car seats until they reach the maximum weight or height limit specified by the car seat manufacturer, according to Cavasino. She adds that, “This is typically around 22-35 pounds or when the top of the child's head is within an inch of the top of the seat. Considering the rapid growth during the early stages of a child's life, infants often outgrow their infant car seats within the first year. As a general guideline, many babies transition to convertible car seats after the age of two, or when they exceed the rear-facing limits.”</p><h3>Can I use a second-hand car seat?</h3><p>“Generally, experts recommend against using second-hand car seats for safety assurance reasons,” warns Colella. “Car seats are safety devices, so their ability to function as designed is critical.”</p><p>“The most important thing you can do is to make sure you know the origin,” says Cavasino. “I recommend always buying your car seat new, but if you do acquire a secondhand car seat, make sure that you trust the source. You want to make sure that it has not been involved in an accident, expired, or been recalled. In certain cases, if a car seat is involved in even a minor collision, it may need to be replaced. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has issued guidelines that outline when parents should replace a car seat after an accident.”</p><p>“Additionally, car seats expire and may have been subject to a recall,” she continues. “You can check the expiration date on the unit itself along with the make, model, and model year.
