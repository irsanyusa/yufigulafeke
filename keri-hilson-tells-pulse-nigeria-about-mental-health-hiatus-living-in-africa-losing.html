Blige, Britney Spears, Ciara </strong>and more, most of us only got to know her on <strong>Timbaland</strong>’s 2007 album, <strong>Shock Value.</strong></p><p>She featured on the smash hit ‘Way I Are’ alongside <strong>D.O.E, </strong>‘Scream’ alongside <strong>Nicole Sherzinger </strong>and ‘Miscommunication.’ But by the middle of 2008, she had been rolled out as a solo act. Songs like ‘Turning Me On’ featuring <strong>Lil Wayne, </strong>the soulful R&B ‘Energy’ and ‘Return The Favour’ launched her into stardom.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Soundtracked by Timbaland<strong>, Danjahandz </strong>and <strong>Polow Da Don, </strong>the <strong>Zone 4/Mosley </strong>act wiped the floor with the best. She also became a sex symbol for young men across the world. Her smash hit single, ‘Knock You Down’ was a smash hit in Nigeria amongst younger millennials who were discovering autonomy and were going through the harsh realities of love.</p><p>At the 2010 Grammy Awards, she was nominated for Best New Artist. Her sophomore album, <strong>No Boys Allowed </strong>on more expansive sounds and the topics were more political/empowering.</p><p>“I do feel like a pioneer of certain vanguard sounds actually, but I didn’t want to admit it for a while,” she jokes. “I like experimenting in the studio..”</p><p>When this writer questioned <strong>Hilson </strong>about what her 2000s sound could have been like without Timbaland, Polow Da Don<strong> </strong>or Danja<strong>, </strong>she says, “I don’t know. I think they produced a lot of ‘In A Perfect World,’ but not as much on ‘No Boys Allowed.’ I think it was just all just a way to experiment with R&B/Pop and I think I achieved that.”</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>Hiatus and mental health</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In 2011, she took a break from music at the peak of her career and stardom due to her mental health.</p><p>“My battle with depression was very dark - I couldn't get out of bed at times. I knew something was wrong before then, but I had to keep going,” she tells <strong>Pulse Nigeria. </strong>“It was tough, but I just knew I had to get away from the pressure of it all. I found healing because I did the things I wanted to do, not things I felt I had to do. I thought it would be short, but I needed that time.”</p><p>At the time, there was talk about how she dissed <strong>Beyonce </strong>on ‘Turning Me On [Remix]’ in 2008. Tension had sprang up after <strong>Usher </strong>replaced her with Beyonce<strong> </strong>on ‘Love In This Club [Remix].’ In a 2009 interview, she rejected the idea that ‘Turning Me On [Remix]’ was a diss, but she did admit that it was Polow Da Don’s idea to record the song - <strong>Polow </strong>has also admitted the same.</p><p>She has also spoken about the toll that the breakup of her 11-year relationship took on her.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>New music, acting and COVID-19</h2></p><p>Her releases over the past 10 years have been sparse, but she tells <strong>Pulse Nigeria </strong>that, ”I didn’t feel like releasing any music at time. When I feel like releasing new music, I will release new music. But I can’t tell you when that will be [laughs]. 2020 has been a really strange year - I actually just lost my father. I don’t think I will release music anytime soon.”</p><p>She has also said that she is looking forward to acting. In 2011, she said that she would want to work with <strong>Quentin Tarrantino. </strong>This year, she says, “I would still like to work with him, I think he’s brilliant. 2011 is a long time ago though - now, I would also like to work with black filmmakers. I love acting.. It makes me feel like a student again.”</p><p>She says the highlight of her year was filming a movie during the pandemic. She says, “We had to get tested every other time, which I hated [laughs] but it was a lot of fun.”</p><p>While most people are scared of coronavirus, she says that she was never scared of the virus. She opines that the virus is not what they tell us it is.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“I think very few people understand the virus,” she says. “I think there is then another side that they are portraying and using as a tool to do other things. That’s all I have to say [laughs]. It’s not just what I believe, it’s what is happening. The biggest lesson from it all for me has been discernment. That’s what we can learn in this ‘new world’ [smiles].”</p><p>She continues, “It’s the only way to tell light from dark or deceit from reality for ourselves. We have to vibrationally be in contact with things.”</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-22>Africa, Nigeria and Pan-Africanism</h2></p><p>In 2019, Ghana had a year of return. Earlier in 2020, <strong>Charlamagne </strong>became one of the many African-American celebrities to purchase property in Africa. Keri Hilson<strong> </strong>is looking to follow suit and acquire property in either Cape Town, South Africa or somewhere in Ghana.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“What has happened in 2020 has made me more resolute in my intention to flee America [laughs]. I’m looking to purchase a property in either Cape Town, South Africa or Ghana,” she jokes. “I like Nigeria - I’ve been there like four times, but I don’t think I’ve really experienced or seen a lot of it. I have some connect on some land in Ghana and South Africa. I don’t have one for Nigeria, but I would like one.”</p><p>Keri Hilson<strong> </strong>feels African-Americans are “displaced people.” And due to that, they don’t have a sense of identity. But over the past 10 years, Hilson<strong> </strong>has been able to evade that because she has regularly travelled to more than 14 African countries. She then feels like most African-American people should find something similar.</p><p>“There’s a sense of belonging you feel when you’re on the ground in an African country. There’s also this discontent that heals in you,” she says with a bright smile.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-28>Religion vs. Spirituality</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Over the past few years, Hilson has slowly become more spiritual than religious. She still believes in God and still identifies as a Christian, but she hasn’t really been going to church as she used to.</p><p>“I believe in Jesus Christ and all the disciples, but I just don’t feel like God is limited to the four walls of every church,” she says. “I’ve been to a lot of churches, but I don’t know if I have felt God in all of them [laughs]. Truth be told, only you can create a relationship with God. Only you can create that alignment and discern it.”</p><p>Keri Hilson is as warm as ever, still wears that glow and smile and she is aging like fine wine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2S4pr7IZp%2BipKOku27AxKWjrGWgqrm0sYynoKCdop6ubq3BqKytZZ2au7Wty2afnpmcqbVutMiaq66rXaG2t7XNoGSipl2Ws7O1wppkpaejnruoe8OhbKlqqK4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./yemeni-abortion-drama-the-burdened-1235312117.html>&#171;&nbsp;We Want to Tell Our Untold Stories, Say the Creators of Yemeni Abortion Drama The Bur</a>
