In addition to the right mattresses and the best bed sheets, picking a bed frame can be daunting since it is a large piece of furniture that can be a significant financial investment, meant to last several years. Fortunately, whether you want an upholstered, cozy nest or a modem adjustable statement piece, there are many quality options available.</p><h2 id=our-picks-for-the-best-bed-frames>Our picks for the best bed frames</h2><h3>Best wooden bed frame, best modern bed frame, and best bed frame for heavy person: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Thuma: the bed</a></h3><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thuma.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Ft15gr55mpxw1%2F2RFp8U2NNVi0CimflXh65O%2F90ccd0a35250ea46862f04f153d31a12%2Fthuma-the-bed-walnut-pillowboard-dark-charcoal-3__5_.png&amp;amp;w=2048&amp;amp;q=75" alt="Thuma: the bed" title="Thuma: the bed" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Thuma: the bed</h3></p><p>Thuma’s bed makes it to the top of our list, and for good reason. The sleek, simple, modern design fits into many types of home styles. The wood is solid and put together with Japanese joinery, needing only one screw, making it one of the easiest pieces of furniture you’ll ever assemble. The high weight limit makes it a great bed for big families who share a bed from time to time, heavy people, and withstanding the force of jumping on the bed. Interesting to note: Thuma doesn’t just make furniture—they also made our list for the best linen sheets.</p><p>After extensive research, this is the bed frame I bought a few years ago. I wanted something modern, but not too ostentatious, that I could put together myself without help, and felt really sturdy to withstand the force of my two active kids who love jumping on the bed. I can say after owning it for a while that I absolutely recommend it. I really did put it together with ease, without any help and it hasn’t budged since. I particularly like the Japanese joinery with rounded edges, so I never hit my shins on the corner of the bed during drowsy mornings. It’s stable enough that I can stand on my bed and jump along with the kids, without worrying about breaking it.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Style: Modern, minimalist</li><li>Material: Wood/fabric headrest</li><li>Dimensions: Queen: 65 inches x 85 inches, 13 inches tall, 9 inches clearance, 35 inch headboard</li><li>Weight Capacity: 1500 pounds</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Extremely easy set up, no tools required</li><li>Clean, attractive design</li><li>High weight limit, feels very sturdy</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>The headrest isn’t attached and requires a wall</li><li>The clearance isn’t much underneath for storage</li><li>Not many customizing options</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>Thuma’s The Bed is an all-around winner due to the easy set up, clean design, and high-quality materials.</p><h3>Best bed frame with storage: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Mr. Kate Blush Moon Upholstered Low Profile Storage Platform Bed</a></h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets.wfcdn.com/im/04809304/compr-r85/1349/134937685/moon-upholstered-platform-storage-bed.jpg alt="Mr. Kate Blush Moon Upholstered Low Profile Storage Platform Bed" title="Mr. Kate Blush Moon Upholstered Low Profile Storage Platform Bed" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Mr. Kate Blush Moon Upholstered Low Profile Storage Platform Bed</h3></p><p>The storage in the Mr. Kate Blush Moon Upholstered Low Profile Storage Platform Bed does, in fact, have a low profile.

However, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Amazon</a> has several of our favorite frames in addition to a long list of well-reviewed frames. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Wayfair</a> has plenty of incredible options, too, and is a good source for finding out user reviews. Otherwise, when you find a frame you like it’s often best to get it directly from the manufacturer’s website. You can guarantee you’re getting the product you want and can often find first-time buyer or returning customer discounts. These direct sales also have good customer service support if you have clarifying questions or issues once your product arrives.</p><h2 id=how-we-chose-the-best-bed-frames-to-recommend>How we chose the best bed frames to recommend</h2><p>We chose the best bed frames based on recommendations from customers, including only bed frames that had a high number of five-star reviews or equivalent. We also looked at other roundups and reviews of the best bed frames to collate the most positively reviewed bed frames currently on sale. Finally, we used our own personal research and recommendations.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-a-bed-frame>What to consider when buying a bed frame</h2><h3>Weight limit</h3><p>Do you sleep alone or with a partner? Do you have kids coming into bed frequently who may or may not be jumping on the bed, exerting a good deal of force? Are you a heavy person, sleep next to a heavy person, or frequently have guests? If the answer is yes, then it would be worth it to pick a bed with a higher weight limit. There is a sense of security in feeling your bed frame is stable that leads to better sleep.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Everyone has a budget and, even for a piece of furniture that will hopefully last a long time, you must keep your price point in mind. Hopefully your bed frame, whatever the price, can be an investment, you’ll have for quite some time.</p><h3>Quality</h3><p>With the idea in mind that you want to buy a bed only a few times in your life, and keeping in mind the hassle of installation and removal of the old frame, picking a bed frame that’s made of quality, high-performing materials is important. There are many inexpensive frames made of cheap material which will give out with too much impact or too quickly.</p><h3>Height and storage</h3><p>Your particular mobility may be what dictates what height is best for you. Someone who cannot squat low or who cannot pull themselves up onto a bed or climb stairs to a tall mattress will want a medium-height bed. A certain amount of clearance is often a good feature if you want to use the bed as storage, either with built in storage or by stashing boxes under the bed. Also consider the height of your mattress in addition to the height of your bed.</p><h3>Headrest or headboard compatibility</h3><p>If your bed floats away from the wall, you may need a headrest to define your bed while adding comfort. If you’re up against the wall and/or are going for a minimalistic look, you may want to forgo one. Some headrests are sturdy and stay put on their own while others require a wall to prop them up and give them the stability to withstand you leaning against them. If you’re buying just a frame and would later like to add a headboard, look for bed frames that are designed to fit a headboard.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>It may sound silly, but having an aesthetically pleasing bed can create a peaceful environment in your home that promotes healthy and restful sleep.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Which bed frame is the strongest?</h3><p>The Thuma has the highest weight limit and is constructed using Japanese joinery, a method that makes it sturdy, easy to install, and tool-free.</p><h3>How expensive is a good bed frame?</h3><p>A good bed frame doesn’t have to be more than a thousand dollars, but many with good reviews, high quality materials, and modern design do top out around that. Many of our choices are well under that amount, hovering around the $200-$800 range, and our picks for budget beds still get great reviews and are around $100. Size also affects the price significantly, with king-sized beds using more materials than a twin and, therefore, costing more.</p><h3>How do I know if my bed frame is good quality?</h3><p>A good quality frame feels solid, isn’t an impossible puzzle to put together, and looks great in your home. Quality furniture can last decades and often has all wood or sturdy metal components.</p><h3>Is it better to have a higher or lower bed frame?</h3><p>Whether or not to have a higher or lower bed frame is a matter of personal preference, mobility needs, and storage requirements. Lower beds can be easier to get in and out of, while high beds are preferable for others for the storage options. Many people prioritize storage over all else, which leads to higher bed frames. Whether or not a bed frame needs a box spring will greatly affect the height.</p><p>The information presented here is created by TIME Stamped and overseen by TIME editorial staff.
