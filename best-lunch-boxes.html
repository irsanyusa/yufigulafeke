I think a lot about how I’m packing lunches in addition to what I’m packing.</p><p>Keeping food at a safe temperature, ensuring their lunch is easy to eat out of the box, and getting their lunch boxes nice and clean at the end of the day—those things are top of mind every single time I pack a lunch. That’s why choosing the right lunch box is so important.</p><p>Whether you’re looking for one that’ll hold an adult’s lunch for a day at the office or a kid’s meal for school, the vessel matters. Of course, each person will value something different: Some won’t consider anything that isn’t dishwasher safe, while others will seek out a lunch box that can keep food hot, for example. With so many options in the lunch box market, there’s something to accommodate everyone.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-lunch-boxes>Our top picks for the best lunch boxes</h2><h3>Best durable lunch box: <a rel=nofollow href=#>GreenLunch Bento 3-in-1 Stainless Steel Bento Box</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best durable lunch box</span></p><p><h3 class=title>GreenLunch Bento 3-in-1 Stainless Steel Bento Box</h3></p><p>When it comes to durability, there’s nothing quite like stainless steel. A lunch box made of this hardy material will last for years. This particular product is not only sturdy, it’s also incredibly functional. The tiered design allows you to pack lots of food, yet the box itself is pretty compact. The box is dishwasher-safe and BPA-free, PVC-free, Phthalate-free, and lead-free. For people who work long hours, this is ideal: The many compartments let you stash a sandwich, a side of fruit and veggies, and a snack to tackle those late afternoon hunger pains.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Stainless steel</li><li>Age range: Adult</li><li>Brand: GreenLunch</li><li>Capacity: 6 cups</li><li>Leak-proof: No</li><li>Size: 7.25 x 3.5 x 5.5 inches</li><li>Insulated: No</li><li>Microwave-safe: No</li><li>Dishwasher-safe: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $38.95</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Made of 100% food-grade stainless steel</li><li>Tiered design allows you to pack lots of food</li><li>Dishwasher-safe</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Some reviewers complain about wear and tear of this item</li><li>On the pricey side</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An efficiently designed stainless steel lunchbox made of food-safe materials.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>GreenLunch Bento 3-in-1 Stainless Steel Bento Box</a></p><h3>Best oversized lunch bag: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Hydro Flask 20L Insulated Lunch Tote</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best oversized lunch bag</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Hydro Flask 20L Insulated Lunch Tote</h3></p><p>If a standard-sized lunch box isn’t cutting it, enter the lunch tote. This one, from Hydro Flask, comes in several sizes ranging from an 8 L capacity (which is great for stashing snacks or a small lunch) to a 35 L option, which would be ideal for taking on a family road trip. But if you’re a commuter looking to pack a lunch for days at the office the medium size is just right. You can pack a full lunch along with a water bottle and some snacks. The tote bag style makes this bag so easy to carry, and the insulated construction is great for keeping food cold. The bag itself is also BPA-free and waterproof. If you add an ice pack, which is sold separately, this will keep food cold for hours. Pro tip: This also doubles as a great reusable bag for grocery shopping.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Polyester</li><li>Age range: Adult</li><li>Brand: Hydro Flask</li><li>Capacity: 20 L</li><li>Leak-proof: No</li><li>Size: ‎17 x 7.25 x 14 inches</li><li>Insulated: Yes</li><li>Microwave-safe: No</li><li>Dishwasher-safe: No</li><li>Price on publish: $64.95</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>A great size for stashing a full lunch…and then some</li><li>Insulated bag keeps food cold (when you add an ice pack)</li><li>Several color options make this a really attractive bag for carrying to the office</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>You’ll need to buy additional containers for food and an ice pack to keep things cold</li><li>On the pricey side</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A sleek, colorful lunch tote that stores a full lunch, plus snacks and more.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Hydro Flask 20L Insulated Lunch Tote</a></p><h3>Best lunch box for adults: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Modetro Sports Flat Bento Box</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best lunch box for adults</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Modetro Sports Flat Bento Box Adult Lunch Box Leak Proof Microwavable Easy to Clean Insulated Lunch Bag Slim Meal Containers for Food Salad Portion Control</h3></p><p>The slim profile of this bento box is one of its greatest features: It allows the box to fit into most work bags or backpacks without taking up much space, yet the box accommodates plenty of food. This bento box is microwave-safe, which is a major plus for adults who want to pack a hot desk lunch. It’s also dishwasher-safe, yet reviewers also say it’s easy to hand wash for people who prefer to go that route. It even comes with an insulated carrying bag. And coming in around $20, it’s an affordable option.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Brass</li><li>Age range: Adult</li><li>Brand: Modetro</li><li>Capacity: 1.8 pounds</li><li>Leak-proof: Yes</li><li>Size: ‎8.5 x 8.27 x 1.75 inches</li><li>Insulated: Yes (comes with an insulated bag)</li><li>Microwave-safe: Yes</li><li>Dishwasher-safe: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $20.49</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Slim, compact bento box slips easily into a work bag</li><li>Includes an insulated bag&nbsp;</li><li>Microwave-safe feature makes heating up lunch at the office so easy</li><li>Freezer-safe, which allows people to meal-prep lunches ahead of time</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Some reviewers claim this doesn’t adequately contain leaks</li><li>May not hold enough food for larger lunches</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This is both freezer-safe and microwave-safe, which makes both meal prep and heating up a hot desk lunch so simple.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Modetro Sports Flat Bento Box</a></p><h3>Best stainless steel lunch box: <a rel=nofollow href=#>PlanetBox Rover Stainless Steel Lunchbox</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best stainless steel lunch box</span></p><p><h3 class=title>PlanetBox Rover Stainless Steel Lunchbox</h3></p><p>If you’re looking to avoid plastics, this lunchbox is ideal: It’s made of stainless steel and contains no lead, PVC, phthalates, or BPA material. The design itself is great for kids: Parents can pack a variety of foods, from a main dish to fruits and vegetables. There’s even a tiny compartment that’s perfect for including a small sweet treat. The stainless steel design is simple (which means you don’t need to worry about paint flaking off when running this through the dishwasher). That is, until you apply decorative magnets (one set is included with the purchase of this lunch box) to the box to add a little pizzazz. You can even purchase additional magnets to change up the look of the lunch box. Two covered dip containers (included with the lunch box) are great for containing dips, sauces, or salad dressings. This item is ideal for kids over three, but adults can use it as well.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Stainless steel</li><li>Age range: Kids</li><li>Brand: PlanetBox</li><li>Capacity: 5 cups/1.2 liters</li><li>Leak-proof: Includes two leak-proof containers</li><li>Size: ‎10 x 7.4 x 1.5 in</li><li>Insulated: No</li><li>Microwave-safe: No</li><li>Dishwasher-safe: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $59.95</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Dishwasher safe</li><li>Comes with two dip containers that can hold “liquidy” items without leaking</li><li>Interchangeable magnets add a fun design element</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Some reviewers claim the latch is tough for kids to open</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A stainless steel lunchbox that’s dishwasher safe and great for kids — especially thanks to the included decorative magnets.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>PlanetBox Rover Stainless Steel Lunchbox</a></p><h3>Best lunch box for kids: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Yumbox Leakproof Bento Lunch Box</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best lunch box for kids</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Yumbox Leakproof Bento Lunch Box</h3></p><p>If there’s one thing kids love, it’s a fun design—and this lunch box delivers that in spades.

Five compartments allow parents to pack a variety of foods, from a main dish to fruit-and-veggie sides, to a small treat.

This electric lunch box is excellent for commuters who prefer a hot meal. Packing a hot soup or stew has never been easier, as you simply have to plug in this container and it’ll keep your food piping hot until you’re ready to eat.

I often don’t have time to make an elaborate lunch, so assembling an “adult lunchable” is a great way to ensure I can get a midday meal in, no matter how busy my day is. One set comes with four boxes in an assortment of colors. And sure, I could just assemble a plate full of crackers, cheese, fruit, veggies, and dip—but these divided containers just make it feel so much more fun. These reusable bento boxes are excellent for meal prep too, as you I’ll be able to assemble lunch and snacks and easily stack them in the fridge. I’ll be using these boxes for my snack-loving kids as well. Did I mention they are microwave, freezer, and dishwasher safe? There are so many ways to use these bento boxes—they’re easy to take on the go, and they’d be the perfect vessel for a TikTok-worthy “girl dinner” as well.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Plastic</li><li>Age range: Adults</li><li>Brand: Lunbxx</li><li>Capacity: 1400 milliliters</li><li>Leak-proof: No</li><li>Size: ‎9 x 6.1 x 2.3 inches</li><li>Insulated: No</li><li>Microwave-safe: Yes</li><li>Dishwasher-safe: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $15.99 (set of four)</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Dishwasher-safe</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Made of plastic&nbsp;</li><li>Not leak- or spill-proof</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A set of reusable bento boxes in a selection of fun colors.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Lunbxx Bento Lunch Boxes</a></p><h3>Best splurge lunch box: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Yeti Daytrip Lunch Box</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best splurge lunch box</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Yeti Daytrip Lunch Box</h3></p><p>Yeti products are known for their durability and superior insulation, two features you can expect from this lunch box as well. These insulated bags come in a variety of vibrant colors, are so easy to clean, and really do a great job of keeping food at a safe temperature. This is a large, open container rather than a structured bento-style box with dividers. While you will probably have to bag or box food items before putting them into this container, you can really fit a lot inside this item.

In addition to being resistant to wear and tear, this lunch box is also able to withstand serious heat: It is microwave-safe, dishwasher-safe, and even oven-safe. With its minimalistic design and frill-free aesthetic, this lunch box is certainly simple—but what it lacks in visual interest, it makes up for in function and durability.

The built-in thermos allows parents to pack a hot meal for their kids, while the box’s other compartments provide space for side dishes right in the same container.</p><p>The box itself is also adorable, comes in a variety of vibrant colors, and includes a small carrying handle. One of the best features here is the versatility. When I don’t want to pack a hot lunch, I can simply remove the included thermos and pack directly in the largest compartment. And while I don’t love sending my kids to school with a plastic lunchbox, this is made of BPA-free materials, which gives me peace of mind.</p><p>That said, this is not the lunch box I reach for most days. It just isn’t the easiest to work with due to its many pieces. Washing the OmieBox at the end of the day is particularly cumbersome.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Plastic</li><li>Age range: Kids</li><li>Brand: OmieBox</li><li>Capacity: 47 ounces, thermos volume 8.5 ounces</li><li>Leak-proof: Yes</li><li>Size: 8.5 x 7.5 x 3 inches</li><li>Insulated: Yes</li><li>Microwave-safe: No</li><li>Dishwasher-safe: No</li><li>Price on publish: $44.95</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Thermos is included within the box, which makes packing a hot lunch alongside side dishes easy</li><li>Very cute, kid-friendly lunch box</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Hard to clean</li><li>Pricey</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An adorable lunch box that gives parents the opportunity to pack a hot meal (alongside multiple side dishes) in an insulated, leak-proof box.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>OmieBox Bento Box</a></p><h3>Best value lunch box: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bentgo Classic Adult Bento Box</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best value lunch box</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Bentgo Classic Adult Bento Box</h3></p><p>Not only one of the most affordable lunch boxes on the market, this box is also arguably the most multi-functional and space-efficient, and that’s why it earns this particular accolade. This particular bento box is so intelligently designed: It contains two separate compartments that stack right on top of one another with a set of included utensils packed in between. This box gives you so many options when it comes to what you pack. Stash a hot meal in one compartment and microwave it, then pack your sides in the other compartment and eat them cold. Or, simply take one compartment on the go if you’re only looking to pack a snack or smaller lunch. The addition of utensils—plus the built-in space to stash them—makes this an even greater value find.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Plastic</li><li>Age range: Adults</li><li>Brand: Bentgo</li><li>Capacity: 2 ¾ cups</li><li>Leak-proof: No</li><li>Size: 7 x 4.2 x 4.5 inches</li><li>Insulated: No</li><li>Microwave-safe: Yes</li><li>Dishwasher-safe: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $14.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Includes two fully functional compartments</li><li>Stackable design makes this very space-efficient</li><li>Included utensils</li><li>Dishwasher and microwave-safe</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Some reviewers are unimpressed with the durability</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Two stackable compartments sandwich included utensils and give you so many options — especially since compartments can be taken apart and microwaved.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bentgo Classic Adult Bento Box</a></p><h3>Most stylish lunch box: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Calpak Insulated Lunch Bag</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Most stylish lunch box</span></p><p><h3 class=title>CALPAK Insulated Lunch Bag in Walnut</h3></p><p>If you prefer to carry your lunch in style, this Calpak bag is the ticket. It’s a lunch carrier that can compete with the most stylish <a rel=alternate href=#>work bags for women</a> in terms of aesthetics. This item isn’t merely fashionable, but functional as well: It boasts multiple compartments, is insulated to keep food cold, and fits other compartments containing multiple food options. The only downside is that you can’t throw unwrapped food directly in, so you’ll likely need an additional box or two to keep food in place. It’s a small price to pay when you essentially get a lunch box and new fashion accessory in one.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Nylon, polyethylene, polyester</li><li>Age range: Adults</li><li>Brand: Calpak</li><li>Leak-proof: No</li><li>Size: 10 x 9 x 7 inches</li><li>Insulated: Yes</li><li>Microwave-safe: No</li><li>Dishwasher-safe: No</li><li>Price on publish: $45</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Cute, fashionable look</li><li>Insulated to keep food at a safe temperature</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Food will have to be contained or packaged before placing in the bag</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An lunch bag that’s attractive enough to double as a purse — and combines both fashion and function.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Calpak Insulated Lunch Bag</a></p><h3>Best freezable lunch box: <a rel=nofollow href=#>PackIt Freezable Classic Lunch Box</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best freezable lunch box</span></p><p><h3 class=title>PackIt Freezable Classic Lunch Box, Men's, Checked Out</h3></p><p>I have these PackIt lunch boxes for my own kids and absolutely love them. It’s just so easy to stash these boxes in the freezer, then pull them out and pack their bento boxes inside along with utensils and napkins. Built-in insulation takes the place of an ice pack. This box fits perfectly inside my kids’ school bags, but it’s also easy to carry by hand. The product holds a lot. You pack a large bento box along with a snack, utensils and a napkin; or a smaller lunch box, water bottle, and snack. With this in mind, you’ll likely be able to fit a full day’s worth of food inside. This item is also available in a variety of cute colorways kids will love; there are also simple color options adults can use. This box is also PVC, BPA, phthalate, and lead-free.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Polyester</li><li>Age range: Kids or adults</li><li>Brand: PackIt</li><li>Capacity: 2.4 liters</li><li>Leak-proof: No</li><li>Size: 10 x 4 x 8 inches</li><li>Insulated: Yes</li><li>Microwave-safe: No</li><li>Dishwasher-safe: No</li><li>Price on publish: $24.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>No need for an ice pack — the insulation in the bag keeps food cold&nbsp;</li><li>Easy to carry</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>You’ll need to contain food in a bento box or package&nbsp;</li><li>Can get heavy</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A freezable lunch box that lets you keep food nice and cold, no ice pack required.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>PackIt Freezable Classic Lunch Box</a></p><h3>Best lunch box with multiple compartments: <a rel=nofollow href=#>gimmiebox Premium Stainless Steel Bento Box With Compartments</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best lunch box with multiple compartments</span></p><p><h3 class=title>gimmiebox premium stainless steel bento box lunch box with compartments for adults, spoon and fork, leak-proof, easy side locks (White)</h3></p><p>This stackable box is compact and easy to fit inside work bags or backpacks for work, yet fits a lot of food thanks to its two-compartment construction. This product includes one large open compartment, as well as another divided compartment. It’s perfect for packing a main dish, like a salad or sandwich in one compartment, while adding a few side items in the divided container. The look of this item is simple, yet aesthetically-pleasing, and there’s even a dedicated space to place the included spoon-and-fork set. It’s also versatile: You can carry either compartment as a standalone lunch box on days you’re packing a smaller lunch. The compartments are microwave-safe and dishwasher-safe.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Stainless steel</li><li>Age range: Adults</li><li>Brand: gimmebox</li><li>Capacity: 950 milliliters</li><li>Leak-proof: Yes</li><li>Size: 8.1 x 4.5 x 4.8 inches</li><li>Insulated: No</li><li>Microwave-safe: Yes</li><li>Dishwasher-safe: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $22.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Compartments stack together for easy packing and storing</li><li>Compartments are dishwasher-safe and microwave-safe</li><li>Utensils are included</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Reviewers complain that the top, which appears to be made of wood, is actually made of plastic</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A stackable two-compartment lunch box that can be used together or separately.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>gimmiebox Premium Stainless Steel Bento Box With Compartments</a></p><h3>Best lunch box for soups: <a rel=nofollow href=#>S’well Eats</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best lunch box for soups</span></p><p><h3 class=title>S’well Eats</h3></p><p>On a cold day, nothing hits the spot like a hot bowl of soup. But let’s face it: Soup isn’t typically what comes to mind when we think of easy foods to pack. Soup can be messy, it needs to be enjoyed at the right temperature, and it can’t be contained in most standard lunch boxes, after all. Enter: This triple-layered insulated bowl, which not only contains soup well, but also keeps it hot for seven hours. One thing we really love about this item is its shape. The bowl-style is great, not just for easy transporting of soup, but also for easy eating. A taller thermos will keep your soup hot, but the bowl shape of this product makes it much more enjoyable to eat directly from. This bowl can also be microwaved if you want your soup even hotter. This lunch box works on days you don’t feel like packing soup for lunch, too. It keeps food cold all day as well, so you can pack a salad, yogurt bowl, or cold soup (think gazpacho) too.</p><h3>Specifications:</h3><ul><li>Materials: Stainless steel</li><li>Age range: Adults</li><li>Brand: S’well</li><li>Capacity: 1.3 pounds</li><li>Leak-proof: Leak resistant</li><li>Size: 4.8 x 4.8 x 4.6 inches</li><li>Insulated: Yes</li><li>Microwave-safe: Yes</li><li>Dishwasher-safe: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $50</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Bowl-shape makes eating soup at your desk easy</li><li>Keeps food hot for hours</li><li>Microwave and dishwasher-safe</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An insulated bowl that makes packing and eating hot soup for lunch so easy.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>S’well Eats</a></p><h3>Best metal lunch box: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bentgo Kids Stainless Steel Leak-Resistant Lunch Box</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best metal lunch box</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Bentgo Kids Stainless Steel Leak-Resistant Lunch Box</h3></p><p>I own a few lunch boxes for my kids, but this Bentgo stainless steel option is far and away our most used. The bento box is large and shallow, which makes packing a variety of foods (from sandwiches to pasta to quesadillas) easy. There’s also ample space for sides, as well as an included silicone container, which is great for adding things like yogurt or pudding into their lunch. I love that this box is made of stainless steel, and I find the shallow compartments inside the box easy to pack, eat out of, and clean.</p><p>However, there are definitely things I don’t love about this box. While it is dishwasher-safe, it is recommended that you hand wash this bento box, which is what I almost always do. With that being said, I have thrown them in the dishwasher a handful times — and after a year and a half, there’s definitely some noticeable paint chipping. These boxes are also heavy, which is to be expected from stainless steel. Overall, though? These are incredibly useful, keep food very cold, and could be used for adults as well.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Stainless steel</li><li>Age range: Kids</li><li>Brand: Bentgo</li><li>Capacity: 32.6 ounces</li><li>Leak-proof: Leak resistant</li><li>Size: 9.8 x 7.6 x 2.2 inches</li><li>Insulated: No</li><li>Microwave-safe: No</li><li>Dishwasher-safe: No</li><li>Price on publish: $49.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Made of stainless steel&nbsp;</li><li>Large compartments hold a lot of food</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Heavy</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A stainless steel bento box with an impressive capacity and slim profile.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bentgo Kids Stainless Steel Leak-Resistant Lunch Box</a></p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-lunch-boxes>What to consider when buying lunch boxes</h2><h3>What you’ll be packing for lunch</h3><p>Do you prefer a hot soup? A big salad? A sandwich with fruit on the side? By visualizing the kind of lunch you’d like to pack, you can narrow down your options to lunchboxes that’ll contain your lunch properly. Some may prefer an undivided container (which is great for storing something like a salad), while others may want something with dividers for storing a few different foods. Others still may prefer a hot lunch, so will want to look for a microwave-safe box, which makes heating up lunch at the office so easy.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Are you looking for something compact enough to fit neatly in your work bag or <a rel=alternate href=#>backpack</a>? Or is it easier for you to stuff hummus, crackers, leftovers, and a water bottle in a bigger tote as you rush out the door. As our <a rel=alternate href=#>kiddos backpacks</a> get bigger and heavier, too, consider what’s most lightweight and packable for everyday (or often) use.</p><h3>Design and materials</h3><p>Lunch boxes come in an array of materials from stainless steel Bento-style boxes to polyester cooling bags. So consider the aesthetic, which is important for both kiddos and adults, as you’ll be using your lunchbox for days—and even years to come. Also, think about the other things you value in a lunch box, which could include attributes like plastic-free and easy-to-clean materials. For example, my kids don’t have access to a fridge at school, so I’ve prioritized buying something that keeps their lunches cold.</p><h2 id=how-to-maintain-lunch-boxes>How to maintain lunch boxes</h2><p>This varies from item to item, but the best rule of thumb is to simply follow the directions outlined by the manufacturer.</p><h2 id=insulation-and-temperature-control>Insulation and temperature control</h2><p>Keeping hot food hot and cold food cold isn’t just a matter of enjoyability, it’s also a safety issue. According to the <a rel=nofollow href=#>United States Department of Agriculture</a>, bacteria grow rapidly when food is between 40 and 140 degrees celsius. If you are packing a lunch and will be leaving it out of the fridge for more than two hours, you’ll want to pack an ice pack, and if you’re eating a hot lunch, you should be sure to pack it in a thermos or insulated container that can keep it hot until you’re ready to eat.</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-lunch-boxes>How we selected the best lunch boxes</h2><p>I used a combination of personal experience, user reviews, and consideration of features when selecting the best lunch boxes. I considered:</p><h3>Capacity & function</h3><p>We looked at the size, shape, and functionality of the lunch boxes we reviewed. Will it easily fit in a backpack or workbag? Does it have a variety of compartments? Will it keep your lunch hot and/or cold? All these were factors in choosing the best lunch boxes.</p><h3>Ease of use and cleaning</h3><p>How easily can kids (and adults) open the lids and containers? Do the boxes have lots of parts that require hand washing? Can we place the box in the freezer, oven, or microwave? We asked ourselves all the questions you would.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>We all love cool lunch boxes—adults and kids alike. Poppy colorways, fun shapes, and included accessories all earned extra points on our list.</p><h3>Budget</h3><p>We reviewed dozens of lunch boxes from value to trendy to splurge. Lunch boxes on this list range from under $20 to $80 to help fit your price point and need.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the best lunch box for work?</h3><p>That comes down to personal preference — and thinking about the kind of food you envision yourself packing matters here. That said, I like a bento-style lunch box (there are several options included on this list) and would consider investing in the Calpak insulated lunch bag if I were a commuter, as it looks great and functions well.</p><h3>Is the Yeti lunch box worth it?</h3><p>The price tag is hefty, but people seem to really love the Yeti lunch box. Ultimately, it’s about the amount of money you’re comfortable spending and whether this particular item fits your needs. The good news? If you decide the price tag on this item is too steep, you have so many other options on the market.</p><h3>What is the best lunch box for commuters?</h3><p>For people who commute long distances, I’d recommend seeking out a lunch box that’s well-insulated. Though the PackIt lunch box is marketed towards kids, I think it would be a wonderful option for a commuter as it can be frozen overnight and packed up the next morning, no ice pack required.</p><h3>How do I clean a lunch box?</h3><p>Follow instructions outlined by the manufacturer. Many boxes can be washed in the dishwasher, but some will require hand-washing.</p><h3>How long can you keep food warm in a lunch box?</h3><p>A lunch box with insulation can keep your food hot for longer than it would remain hot at room temperature. For example, the S’well Eats bowl can keep your food hot for seven hours, according to the product description.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnKq7pLSMm6axnaNk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./transports-publics-clement-beaune-veut-un-billet-unique-dans-deux-ans.html>&#171;&nbsp;Clment Beaune veut un &amp;quot;billet unique&amp;quot; dans deux ans</a>
