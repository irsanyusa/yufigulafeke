In general, it can symbolise good fortune, success, prosperity, longevity, courage and perseverance. Many <a href=#>people</a> attribute Koi fish to several lessons and trials they encounter in life. Before delving deeper into the Koi fish meanings and symbolism, what is the history of this vibrant animal and what makes it unique?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/30ae26bec198e5f7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sharks killed at alarming rates despite regulations: study</span></p></a><h3>Koi fish history</h3><p class=align-left>Koi fish trace their origins back to China, where the selective breeding of these ornamental carp first began. The fish was initially bred as a food source, but the gradual emergence of vibrant colours and unique patterns led to the cultivation of carp for ornamental purposes. During the <a href=#>Edo</a> period in Japan, Koi-keeping became a symbol of status and wealth.</p><p class=align-left>The Japanese observe the unique behaviours of Koi, particularly their ability to swim upstream against strong currents, which contributed to the association of Koi with qualities like perseverance and determination. It was in the 20th century that carp were introduced to the Western world and later spread across Europe and the United States.</p><h3>Koi fish meaning (spiritual)</h3><p class=align-left>The spiritual meaning of Koi fish is deeply rooted in Japanese and Chinese cultures. Explore the Koi fish symbolism:</p><h4>1. Transformation and perseverance</h4><p class=align-left>The Koi fish is regarded as a symbol of transformation and perseverance because of their ability to swim upstream against ferocious currents. That is why this fish is associated with personal growth and the ability to navigate various life challenges.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cb9acb80a16f1271.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>33 symbols of strength found in different cultures</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For instance, there is a famous Chinese legend about a group of koi fish that swim upstream in the Yellow River. They persevered over the strong currents as they swam upstream and finally transformed into dragons after crossing the Dragon's Gate. This metaphor is used for people who <a href=#>overcome obstacles</a> to achieve their goals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/30ae26bec198e5f7.jpg><p class=align-left>Japanese people liken the Koi fish to samurai warriors. This is because the fish face adversity while migrating upstream, similar to how samurai warriors face challenges beyond their control. Another similar trait between the two is how the Japanese warriors would accept death before dishonour, and the carp are also known to stay still when they get caught.</p><h4>2. Good luck and prosperity</h4><p class=align-left>The word "Koi" in Chinese <a href=#>can</a> mean both abundance and wealth. It also symbolises success and prosperity in life. This mainly applies to white carp with red or orange patches (Kohaku).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3dcec5ff52e62f40.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What do cardinals represent?

Harmony with nature</h4><p class=align-left>This vibrant animal holds deep <a href=#>symbolic meaning</a> in Asian cultures, particularly regarding harmony with nature. Koiâs ability to thrive naturally in various water environments makes it flexible and attuned to the natural world's ever-changing rhythms.

Caring for the carp fosters a spiritual connection with the natural <a href=#>world</a>.</p><h4>5. Feng Shui significance</h4><p class=align-left>In Feng Shui, the ancient Chinese people considered Koi to be powerful symbols of positive energy flow, known as "chi."
