One of the most annoying forms of communication is the silent treatment. Not responding to a question or a matter is uncomfortable, regardless of the relationship. However, silence is the loudest form of communication.</p><h2 id=1580949-no-response-is-a-response-meaning class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>No response is a response meaning</h2><p class=align-left>Getting no response seems like failed communication. When you don't get the silent treatment from someone, it <a href=#>can</a> trigger you to press the person for a reply. However, sometimes, no response is a response in itself. Below is a list of what no response is a response could mean.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f40d14f45f381f09.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does message blocking is active mean and how to resolve it?</span></p></a><h3 id=1580949-1-they-are-busy class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>1. They are busy</h3><p class=align-left>Being busy is one of the common excuses people give after being silent for a while. Although it is a lousy excuse, in some cases, the person could not respond due to a busy schedule. The schedule could be work-related or attending to a personal matter.</p><p class=align-left>For example, someone under pressure to meet deadlines at work may choose silence as it may not be a convenient time to respond. This often happens when looking for someone's attention online or on the phone.</p><p class=align-left>While it makes sense for the person to send a message letting you know they are busy at the moment, some people just assume and stay quiet.</p><h3 id=1580949-2-they-don39t-know-what-to-say class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. They don't know what to say&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p class=align-left>Sometimes, the person doesn't have an answer or know what to say. In some situations, someone may genuinely have nothing to say regarding a situation. They, therefore, choose silence in the form of a blank stare, unanswered <a href=#>text messages</a> or emails or a silent moment on call.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7e0d17abf099c363.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ being ignored quotes for when you are feeling overlooked</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For example, the question is outside their area of expertise. In such a case, no response is better than a response. Although the silence in this case is valid, it is prudent to state that you don't know what to say instead of staying silent.</p><h3 id=1580949-3-they-are-processing class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>3. They are processing&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f40d14f45f381f09.jpg><p class=align-left>Another meaning of no response is that the person may be processing the information or question. This may happen when the information is unexpected, or you dropped a bombshell for something.</p><p class=align-left>Some people take time to process and need their space to do so. This means they will respond later, but it will take time.</p><h3 id=1580949-4-they-may-think-the-conversation-is-over class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4. They may think the conversation is over</h3><p class=align-left>Some people stop responding because they think the conversation is over. You could be texting someone and then leave the chat only to find a horde of texts from the other party. You simply thought the conversation was over and moved to other things.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/52baf77206fcdf36.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a conversation with a guy: best openers to try out</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Although no response is a response, this situation warrants you to cut people some slack. This is because they may genuinely not know communication is still ongoing.</p><h3 id=1580949-5-they-don39t-want-to-talk-to-you class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>5. They don't want to talk to you</h3><p class=align-left>People rarely. When someone doesn't respond, you may assess the situation and conclude that the person is uninterested in talking to you. This happens mostly in relationships or even friendships. The person ignores your calls or texts for unknown reasons.</p><h3 id=1580949-6-they39re-afraid-to-say-quotnoquot class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>6. They're afraid to say "No."</h3><p class=align-left>Most people fear saying no to others, especially those they love. Saying no is construed to be rude and makes people feel bad. It is, therefore, easier to stay silent to avoid hurting people's feelings. When faced with such a situation, do not force the person to respond to you, but take the no reply to mean no.</p><h3 id=1580949-7-they39re-not-interested class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>7. They're not interested&nbsp;</h3><p class=align-left>No response is a response, and it's a powerful one, especially when someone is not interested. The lack of interest cuts across the board. It may stem from a <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/quotes-messages/1563454-relationship-quotes-relate-to/ href=#>new romance</a>, a platonic friendship, a working relationship or a business partner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2d1e179890d9d446.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Right person, wrong time: 13 signs it might be happening to you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For example, you may get the silent treatment after asking someone for a date. They ignore you because you are not their type or don't like you. They want to let you down easily without hurting your feelings. When this happens, it is essential to realise that they are uninterested in you, and you must move on.</p><h2 id=1580949-what-to-do-when-someone-doesn39t-reply-to-you class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>What to do when someone doesn't reply to you?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7e0d17abf099c363.png><p class=align-left>Finding yourself waiting for communication from someone can be confusing.

When you find yourself in a silent treatment situation, take these steps.</p><h3 id=1580949-1-remember-no-response-is-a-response class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>1. Remember, no response is a response</h3><p class=align-left>Remind yourself that silence is communication in many cases. This then prepares you for anything the next step and will give you emotional strength when dealing with the person.</p><h3 id=1580949-2-change-the-topic class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. Change the topic</h3><p class=align-left>This is best when you suspect that you have dumped information on the other person that needs time or they can't answer. Changing the topic removes pressure and allows them to digest and respond appropriately later.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/669f664efa8fbb03.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>125+ funny things to say to break silence in any situation</span></p></a><h3 id=1580949-3-try-to-follow-up-and-reach-out-later class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>3. Try to follow up and reach out later</h3><p class=align-left>Another simple way to restart a conversation with someone who had gone mute is to follow up and reach out again. However, ensure that you have given them ample time to respond before reaching out again.</p><h3 id=1580949-4-request-for-a-convenient-time class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4. Request for a convenient time&nbsp;</h3><p class=align-left>One of the common reasons why people do not respond is that they have been busy and may have been dealing with a lot. In this case, ask for a convenient time to have the conversation. You can use the following to get the answers you need.</p><ul><li>Are you available for a quick talk?</li><li>Is it a good time?</li></ul><h3 id=1580949-5-be-direct class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>5. Be direct</h3><p class=align-left>Sometimes, people only respond to you if they understand you. In this case, you must eliminate ambiguity and be direct with your inquiry or conversation. Ensure your conversation is direct and it gives you quick answers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/51dcf84dd675f437.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is an exclusive relationship, and how should it work?</span></p></a><h3 id=1580949-6-know-when-to-quit class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>6.

If you have tried all the above and still have no communication, you should take a bow. The person is uninterested in talking to you and may not want to hurt your feelings.</p><h2 id=1580949-is-no-response-a-rejection class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Is no response a rejection?</h2><p class=align-left>Silence is not a rejection. Silence carries a <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/quotes-messages/1486446-powerful-morning-prayer-messages-start-day-god/ href=#>powerful message </a>but does not necessarily mean rejection.</p><h2 id=1580949-is-no-response-better-than-a-response class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Is no response better than a response?</h2><p class=align-left>The science behind not responding to someone is hinged on the fact that a long silence could lead to someone leaving you alone. Sometimes, no response is better than a response, as it would do more harm than good.
