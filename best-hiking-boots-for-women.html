Well known amongst the outdoor community for their comfort, performance, low weight, and affordability, the Merrell Moab has long been the hiking boot of choice for a wide range of people, especially new hikers. Made for rugged terrain, the Moab contains an air cushion for shock absorption, ankle support, a contoured footbed, and mesh panels for breathability (so your feet don’t get sweaty).

I also extensively researched online reviews to come up with selections that consistently received high marks in durability, comfort, support, weight, and traction.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-hiking-boots-for-women>How to choose the best hiking boots for women</h2><p>There are a lot of options available online from a variety of retailers including Backcountry, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Columbia, or most anywhere that also sells <a rel=alternate href=#>walking shoes</a> and <a rel=alternate href=#>winter boots</a>. When deciding which hiking boots to purchase, consider the following:</p><h3>Terrain/location</h3><p>If you’re planning on sticking mainly to well-maintained trails, look for a lightweight hiking boot or even trail <a rel=alternate href=#>running shoes</a>. For long hikes and backpacking expeditions, you’ll need something a bit more substantial that offers extended durability and support.</p><h3>Fit</h3><p>Whether you want boots to fit with extra room or not depends on the socks you plan to wear as well as the climate you’re hiking in, Grandizio told me. Which is part of the reason she owns so many pairs—she has some in more than one size.</p><p>“First, I always wear a wool sock,” she told me. Wool socks come in a variety of thicknesses. SmartWool, for instance, makes a <a rel=nofollow href=#>lightweight wool sock</a> that will fit differently than a heavier one. Grandizio said, “It might be the difference of a half size.”</p><p>In general, she recommends a boot fit snugly but not too tight. If your foot moves up and down, you’ll develop blisters. Also, don’t forget that hiking footwear needs to be broken in, even all of the non-leather versions included here. Boots will mold to your feet the more you wear them, often becoming more comfortable over time, so don’t embark on a long multi-day hike in a brand new pair of boots.</p><h3>Waterproof vs. water-resistant</h3><p>If you know you’re going to use your boots in snowy or rainy conditions you’ll likely want a full waterproof style to keep your feet dry. These won’t be as breathable as a water-resistant boot (though all waterproof boots should feature some kind of breathable inserts and/or features). The lack of breathability means your feet could get sweaty when hiking in warmer temperatures.</p><h3>Season/climate</h3><p>Winter conditions not only call for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best winter jackets and coats for women</a> but also boots. Most brands offer a winter style of hiking boot that will be waterproof and contain insulation to protect your feet from the cold.</p><h2 id=tips-for-care-and-maintenance>Tips for care and maintenance</h2><p>Keep your boots clean and dry, rinsing them off with a hose then scrubbing with a vegetable brush after an especially mucky or muddy hike. Never dry your boots near a heater as that can crack any leather parts and/or melt the soles. All boots will dry faster if you stuff them with crumpled up newspaper which will absorb the moisture.</p><p>If you’ve been out in the rain, remove the insoles and allow them to air dry. If you’ve trekked through salt water, rinse them off as soon as possible because the salt will rust any metal parts, like eyelets.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the difference between hiking shoes and hiking boots?</h3><p>While Grandizio says she basically refers to everything as a hiking boot, what differentiates them from hiking shoes is that they have a mid or higher ankle height, which many people need for the support. “I find for myself (being petite in stature) that a heavy boot that comes up high doesn't serve me as well,” she said.</p><p>“But definitely if you're new out on the trails, you really should have that ankle support,” she added.</p><h3>Can I wear hiking boots for walking?</h3><p>Many hiking boots are just as suitable for walking as they are for trekking and hiking. The heavier boots made for alpine adventures will definitely be overkill if you’re just strolling about town, though they’re unlikely to cause any kind of damage or discomfort. If you’re backpacking across multiple countries, your hiking boots are very likely the only footwear you have with you (aside from a pair of shower flip flops), so wearing them while walking will be your best option anyway.</p><h3>Are sneakers okay for hiking?</h3><p>Grandizio says she’s been out on the trail with people in sneakers and flip flops. “And I just don't think it's safe because you can twist an ankle,” she said. There’s a difference, though, between sneakers made for running on pavement and actual trail runners,which can work in certain hiking conditions. But she added, “You're definitely not going to wear trail runners out on some rugged trail.”</p><p>“Sneakers are a little flatter on the bottom, and their treads are not as deep,” Grandizio explained. This means that if you encounter a slippery situation such as ascending a rocky surface, a sneaker won’t provide a good enough grip. Trail hiking boots are designed with deeper treads that provide more grip, as well as support for your feet.</p><p>Padilla doesn’t recommend hiking in sneakers either for all the same reasons. “Different terrain offers different risks,” she said, “and should be conducted at your own risk.” If you only have sneakers and want to do an easy hike, she suggests sticking to paved nature trails.</p><h3>Should hiking shoes be firm or soft?</h3><p>This depends somewhat on personal preference as well as on what type of hiking you’re doing. For alpine hikes or backpacking trips you’ll likely prefer a firmer shoe for the added support. Softer shoes, which tend to be lighter, work great on day hikes.</p><h3>What are the best hiking boots when carrying a heavy pack?</h3><p>When carrying heavy packs, most people will benefit from a sturdy pair of boots that feature sufficient ankle support. Lighter weight boots and hiking shoes likely won’t provide a solid and substantial enough base nor enough cushioning to help offset the feel of carrying a great deal of weight.
